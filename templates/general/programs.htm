                <strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong>
I appreciate, believe, support and honor this. I know this. <strong>Black lives matter.</strong>  If you don’t understand, look into it. Don’t dismiss it. If you do understand: Remember it, say it, hold yourself in it and express solidarity with this: <strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong>

Those of you who know me through Suzuki know that what I love about the Suzuki Philosophy is the nurturing of the human Spirit through love and devotion, and through an intentionally created musical environment. <strong>I express here my eternal gratitude and debt to the Santa Cruz, African-American, church-going Santa Cruz community that has been an integral part of my life for 25 years or more. There would not be a Kate Alm Suzuki Piano Studio without you.</strong> My paternal great grandparents, Czech Jews, established a piano emporium in Vienna in the 1880’s.  My grandfather immigrated to Chicago in 1923; our family history is profoundly impacted by the Nazi occupation of  Austria in the 1930’s, it’s effect on his 8 siblings and parents, and my grandfather’s subsequent efforts to aid family members and Jewish colleagues in escaping persecution. My parents shared their love of music with me. And YOU, by allowing me to learn from and for you, have been the bridge for me; you have allowed me to be my true musical self and to authentically pass on the gifts that have been given to me. The learning by ear, learning together, in an atmosphere of love, support, cooperation, across generations ,in coming back to old songs continually, in practicing being a part of life, not a duty, in an intangible communal sense, you represent all the learning that I have passed on through my Suzuki studio. You have enriched far more than my musical life.

It was a joy to play the set at the Civic at the UCSC MLK Convocation last February 10th, to play music we’ve all been playing and singing over the years, in honor of Dr. King  …with drummer Jordan Garnett, and again to play at the SC Warriors Black Heritage Night with Jen Taylor -Daniels. Now that seems like such a luxury, to have gathered that way. But it will be a source of comfort ,encouragement and inspiration to me in the months and years to come. <strong>I stand in solidarity with you. I am here for you in any way you need me. </strong>

My first idol was Maya Angelou. My second was Aretha. But it was YOU in Santa Cruz who made their messages part of my identity, even as I went further out and joined the Gospel Music Workshop of America:
<strong><br>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE, YOUR ACCEPTANCE, YOUR PATIENCE, YOUR WARMTH ,YOUR EMBRACE.
    <br><h4 style="font-weight: bold">YOUR LIVES, HOPES,DREAMS,SONS AND DAUGHTERS MATTER. </h4>
    <br><h2>BLACK LIVES MATTER.</h2></strong>

<br>Here are many of your sons and daughters from our collaboration over 15 years ago! We play music together still. This is a beautiful snapshot of our shared experience.
