                <strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong>
I appreciate, believe, support and honor this. I know this. <strong>Black lives matter.</strong>  If you don’t understand, look into it. Don’t dismiss it. If you do understand: Remember it, say it, hold yourself in it and express solidarity with this: <strong>Black Lives Matter.</strong>
<p>
Those of you who know me through Suzuki know that what I love about the Suzuki Philosophy is the nurturing of the human Spirit through love and devotion, and through an intentionally created musical environment. <strong>I express here my eternal gratitude and debt to the Santa Cruz, African-American, church-going Santa Cruz community that has been an integral part of my life for 25 years or more. There would not be a Kate Alm Suzuki Piano Studio without you.</strong> My  paternal great grandparents, Czech Jews, established a piano emporium in Vienna in the 1880’s. In the 1930’s, my grandfather was able to leave before the Nazis completely occupied the country,(and later they would seize the family home for themselves.) My parents shared their love of music with me. And YOU, by allowing me to learn from and for you, have been the bridge for me; you have allowed me to be my true musical self and to authentically pass on the gifts that have been given to me. The learning by ear, learning together, in an atmosphere of love ,support, cooperation, across generations ,in coming back to old songs continually, in practicing being a part of life, not a duty, in an intangible communal sense, you represent all the learning that I have passed on through my Suzuki studio. You have enriched far more than my musical life. 
<p>
It was a joy to play the set at the Civic at the UCSC MLK Convocation last February 10th, to play music we’ve all been playing and singing over the years, in honor of Dr. King  …with drummer Jordan Garnett, and again to play at the SC Warriors Black Heritage Night with Jen Taylor -Daniels. Now that seems like such a luxury, to have gathered that way. But it will be a source of comfort ,encouragement and inspiration to me in the months and years to come. <strong>I stand in solidarity with you. I am here for you in any way you need me. </strong>
<p>
My first idol was Maya Angelou. My second was Aretha. But it was Santa Cruz who brought it home and made it real for me, even as I went further out and joined the Gospel Music Workshop of America:
<strong><br>THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE, YOUR ACCEPTANCE, YOUR PATIENCE, YOUR WARMTH ,YOUR EMBRACE.
    <br><h6>YOUR LIVES, HOPES,DREAMS,SONS AND DAUGHTERS MATTER. </h6>
    <br><h4>BLACK LIVES MATTER.</h4></strong>

{# <br>Here are many of your sons and daughters from our collaboration over 15 years ago! We play music together still. This is a beautiful snapshot of our shared experience. #}

                <p>It has taken me years to develop a method for introducing students to the Suzuki Method; it is very rewarding and well worth the investment of your time. This process educates both the parent and child thoroughly, so that when your child begins lessons, he experiences success, excellence, and joy from the very beginning. To get the best possible start in piano and ensure success for your child I require the following:</ol>
                <li>
                    <ol>Sign up to observe a private and group lesson; schedule a 30 minute consultation with me. Receive and read <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/Observation.pdf" target="_blank">observation etiquette</a> handout. There is no cost for this. </ol>
                    <ol>Enroll in my 10-week Fall or Spring Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class. Book and CD included. Cost: $250.</p>
                    <ol>After you and your child have completed the Suzuki Piano Immersion and Introductory Class, you will be eligible to enroll for lessons. Enrollment is a 45 minute session in which we discuss your and your child's experience so far, (child does not attend), I answer any questions you have, and we go over the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a> and other handouts together. Cost: $40.</ol>
                </li>
                <p>To learn more about the dates for the immersion program, as well as to access a repository of all the documents referenced above, please click <a href="{% url 'general:immersion' %}">here</a>.</p>

            <header id="banner-summer">Summer &amp School Year Policies</header>
            <div class="container-content">
                <p>During the school year, I schedule lessons at a regular time each week for individual instruction as well as for group lessons. I also conduct all-studio lessons on Fridays about 5 times a year. There are also 5-6 recitals a year.</p>
                <p>If your child is sick during the school year, please do not hesitate to cancel. This is in everyone’s best interest and the lesson can be rescheduled. Absense for other reasons is not refundable; however, you may trade times with any other student to make up for lost lessons. All of this information is included in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/StudioPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">studio policy</a>.</p>
                <p>Group duos are suspended for the summer - except if you expressly request a summer duo - so that I can work with the children individually on their reading, theory, rhythm and solfa skills. Therefore in place of group duo, you receive 10 extra minutes. Sometimes I use the extra time to just chat with your child about how his summer is going. It is a very nice break from the more formalized lessons during the school year! More information about about summer is in my <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ka-public/PDFs/SummerInfo.pdf" target="_blank">summer fees and fact sheet</a>. </p>
